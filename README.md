 > ### Technology Stack
  - **Django:** a web framework for building RESTful APIs.
  - **PostgreSQL:** a relation database management system.
  - **GraphQL:** a query language and server-side runtime for APIs.
 > ### Database Design
  **Key Entities and Fields**
  - **Users:** User Id, first name, last name, email address, Address
  - **Bookings:** Booking Id, Property Id, Check in date, Check out date, number of guest
  - **Reviews:** Review Id, Property Id, Booking Id, Rating, Reviewer Id  
  - **Payments:** Payment Id, Amount, Currency, Payment Type, Payment Status
    
  **Entities Relationship**

  - **Rate limiting:** Rate limitiing are security policies and procedures within the property management system which will ensure the integrity of the business process. This will be achieved through impementing business rules within the application logic.

    **Security is crucial in the following key areas:**
    -  **Protecting user data:** This ensure the privacy, integrity, and the right use of the user data are observed within the law guidelines and best practice framework.
    -  **Securing payments:** This ensures that only aouthorized and approved payments are process. It protects fraudulent activities by unauthorized users.  
 > ### CI/CD Pipeline
   CI/CD pipelines are the automated processes in software development, testing, and deployment. 
   CI/CD pipelines are important in the software development cycle because it ensure continiues integration software features, faster deploymnet of application, flexibilty, and agility in software development.
   The following CI/CD tools will be used in this project
   + Docker
   + GitHub Actions
   + Jenkins
